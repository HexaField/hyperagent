Keep implementation minimalistic and modular. Follow the code style, standards and patterns already established in the codebase.

Test cases should fail if the implementation is incorrect or incomplete.

DO NOT add gates or feature flags for new functionality. All new code must be active by default.

When adding new functionality, ensure that it integrates seamlessly with existing features.

NEVER add stubs or placeholders. All functions and methods must have complete implementations.

Always install dependencies with `npm i package@latest` to ensure the latest version is used.
